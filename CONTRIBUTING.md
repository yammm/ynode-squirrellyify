## Release Process

Release metadata is prepared locally and publication is performed by the tag-only GitHub Actions workflow using npm trusted publishing.

1. Start from a clean, synchronized `main` branch.
2. Run `npm run release:patch`, `npm run release:minor`, or `npm run release:major`.
3. Review the generated changelog, signed commit, and signed `vX.Y.Z` tag.
4. Push both together with `git push --follow-tags`.

The helper runs every publication gate after setting the clean SemVer, stages only `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`, signs and signs off the release commit, and creates a signed tag. It never pushes or publishes. The release workflow verifies the signed tag, version, changelog, main-branch ancestry, and exact packed artifact before publishing with OIDC and registry provenance.

Configure the npm trusted publisher for this repository and `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Do not add a long-lived npm token.
